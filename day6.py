### This was an interesting one. The original algorithm worked for both parts 1 and 2
### but was slower than I wanted for part 2. In my chat, I looked through the code
### and identified the issue, then suggested a more general approach that would be
### quicker (using a mathematical formula).

### Importantly, chatGPT was able to basically immediately identify that it could be
### modelled with the quadratic formula. I would have gotten there myself eventually
### but it would have taken longer. 5 minutes? 15? An hour? I dunno, I'm mostly
### skimming the problems and trying not to think about them too much.

### But then, after identifying the correct approach, it couldn't get the edge cases
### right, so it just... gave up on the efficient solution and went back to counting.
### Part of the theoretical exposition I gave to it at the end was me talking
### through the problem myself and part of it was not wanting to write the code that
### represented my thinking. It still produced the wrong code lol, but was basically
### there, and it took only one correction. Will be interesting to see what happens
### with more complicated problems.
